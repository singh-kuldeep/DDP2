1. Implement the NRBC at exit as well so that in case of subsonic flow this can be applied. Currently, solver can handle only supersonic exit

2. Robust reading of input file 
	a) There is error when extra space

3. Start the solution from the previous solution(Initial condition should be same as previous solution)

4. Implement the local time stepping to make the solver converge faster

5. How to set deltat value in case of global time step
